In this I am demonstrating how to use Python and pandas to perform basic data transformations on a CSV file.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the pandas library by running the following command in your terminal: pip install pandas

# Data Transformations
The script  performs the following transformations on the data:

Increases the age of each person by 1.
Converts location names to uppercase.
Converts names to uppercase.

# Output
After running the script, you'll find a new CSV file named "output.csv" in the project folder. This file contains the transformed data.
